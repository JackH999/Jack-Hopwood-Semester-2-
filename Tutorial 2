Coding camera follow and player movement

First make a plane and get a cube and call it player. 
Add a Rigidbody to the cube "Player"

We will start by writing the camera follow code to the player. 
 public GameObject face;  - This lets us drag the gameobject the camera will be following into the available box we will have when we are done.   
 private Vector3 offset;  
 
 Next under void start write 
 offset = transform.position - face.transform.position; - This recongnises the start position of the player
 
 under void update write 
 transform.position = face.transform.position + offset;   - This recongises when the player moves, the camera will follow it. 
 
 Now we can write the player movement code
 first thing to write is public float movementSpeed;  - This just enables us to change the movement speed on the tab
 
 next write 
  if (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.LeftShift) && Input.GetKey("w"))
        {
            transform.position += transform.TransformDirection(Vector3.forward) * Time.deltaTime * movementSpeed * 2.5f;
        }
        else if (Input.GetKey("w") && !Input.GetKey(KeyCode.LeftShift))
     - This tells unity that if I press the W key on the keyboard it will move forward at a set speed
     
     now we have to do this for the ASD keys
      else if (Input.GetKey("s"))
        {
            transform.position -= transform.TransformDirection(Vector3.forward) * Time.deltaTime * movementSpeed;
        }

        if (Input.GetKey("a") && !Input.GetKey("d"))
        {
            transform.position += transform.TransformDirection(Vector3.left) * Time.deltaTime * movementSpeed;
        }
        else if (Input.GetKey("d") && !Input.GetKey("a"))
        {
            transform.position -= transform.TransformDirection(Vector3.left) * Time.deltaTime * movementSpeed;
            
            This also tells unity that when you press A it will move left, when you press D it will move right and when you press S it will move backwards
